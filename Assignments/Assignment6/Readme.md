->Event Bubbling:-  
Event bubbling is a method of event propagation in the HTML DOM API when an event is in an element inside another element, and both elements have registered a handle to that event. It is a process that starts with the element that triggered the event and then bubbles up to the containing elements in the hierarchy. In event bubbling, the event is first captured and handled by the innermost element and then propagated to outer elements.    


->Event Capturing:-  
Event Capturing is opposite to event bubbling, where in event capturing, an event moves from the outermost element to the target. Otherwise, in case of event bubbling, the event movement begins from the target to the outermost element in the file. Event Capturing is performed before event bubbling but capturing is used very rarely because event bubbling is sufficient to handle the event flow.
