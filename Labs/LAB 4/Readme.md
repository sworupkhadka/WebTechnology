OBJECTIVE   

To implement event handling function in Javascript  

->Many event listeners are frequently used; recall the click of a button that takes you to another website or the mouse scroll? All of this is accomplished through the use of various event handlers, and the mechanism is known as event handling.  

->Events in Java:-  
Events in Java represent the change in the state of any object. Events occur when the user interacts with the interface. Clicking a button, moving the   mouse, typing a character, selecting an item from a list, and scrolling the page are all examples of behaviours that cause an event to occur.  

->Events are divided into two major categories:-   

1. Foreground Events: These events necessitate the user's direct participation. They are produced as a result of a user interacting with graphical components in a Graphical User Interface.     

2. Background Events: Background events are those that require end-user interaction. Operating system interrupts and hardware or software failure are examples of background events. 

 3. Event handling in Java is the process of controlling an event and taking appropriate action if one occurs.   

->How are Events Handled?  
The modern approach to event processing is based on the Delegation Model. It defines a standardized and compatible mechanism for generating and processing  events. In this approach, a source generates an event and sends it to one or more listeners. The listener sits and waits for an event to   occur. When it gets an event, it is processed by the listener and returned. The user interface elements can delegate the processing of an event to a   different function.  

CONCLUSION  
We learnt the implementation event handling function in JS.
